### Bio
I am geographer with a broad interest in human dimensions of natural resources and geographic data science. I have extensive experience with conservation biology, environmental policy, demography, geographic information systems (GIS), data analysis, and data visualization. I work for the State of Vermont at the Vermont Center for Geographic Information, which provides open GIS data for the State. I have over 15 years of experience with the full ESRI stack, and stay up-to-date with that kit for my professional work. However, I prefer to work with open source tools like QGIS, PostGIS, and the increasing spatial capabilities of R and Python. In my spare time I make furniture and try not to fall off my bike on the back roads of Vermont.
