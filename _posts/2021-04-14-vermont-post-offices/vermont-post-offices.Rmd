```

Get the data - I'll filter down to Vermont.
```{r data}
post_offices <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-04-13/post_offices.csv')

vt_post_offices <- post_offices %>% 
  filter(state == "VT")
```

Lets look at when post offices were established
```{r}
vt_post_offices %>%
  group_by(established) %>%
  tally() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x= established, y = n)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(span = .1, se = FALSE)
```
And the same, but for discontinued.
```{r}
vt_post_offices %>%
  drop_na(discontinued) %>% 
  group_by(discontinued) %>%
  tally() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x= discontinued, y = n)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(span = .1, se = FALSE, color="orange")
```
